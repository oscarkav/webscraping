python selenium scrape a webpage that is downloaded with Chrome addon DownThemAll!!
the page downloaded were not able to be opened as it is. Needed to remove the javascript parts 
download the files and put them on same folder
the files are in the same format for me and I have several files.
edit in the .py file the correct patch to the folder
run the .py file and it will create a new html file with the extracted details from the files.
